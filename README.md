Hi, I’m Milind

I'm all about pushing humanity forward, with two big dreams: creating endless clean energy and exploring space. Energy is key to climbing the Kardashev scale, and space is the final frontier for our adventurous spirit. Currently though, I'm working on KiForge - The AI layer for KiCAD, to bring to PCB designers the same acceleration Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex gave to software engineers.
