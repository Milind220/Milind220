Hi, I’m Milind

Currently obssessing over making PCB design 10x faster and better. 
There's a bottleneck in engineering - Code can be written in minutes, PCBs take weeks. It's inevitable that it changes. I want to bring about that change.

I'm building KiForge - The AI layer for KiCAD, to bring to PCB designers the same acceleration CoPilot, Cursor, and Claude Code brought to software engineers.

Projects you'd find interesting:

- 🦀 [KiCAD-IPC-RS](https://github.com/milind220/kicad-ipc-rs) - Rust bindings for the KiCAD IPC API!
- 𜷷 [Agent SDK](https://github.com/Milind220/agent-sdk-rs) - A reimplementation of Browser Use's Agent SDK in Rust. The simplest, most effective harness you will ever use.

(there's going to be more here every time you check)
